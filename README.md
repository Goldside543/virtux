# Virtux
A version of the Linux kernel I made to really support virtualization! Files coming soon.
# **THIS KERNEL WILL ONLY FUNCTION ON HARDWARE THAT SUPPORTS VIRTUALIZATION.**
To see if your hardware supports Virtux, dig around in your BIOS/UEFI to find a "virtualization" option. If none exist, your hardware does not support Virtux.
